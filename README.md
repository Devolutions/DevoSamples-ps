# DevoSamples-ps
Devolutions PowerShell module samples scripts.

The repository is divided in four areas:

## custom_batch_actions
Small fragments of PowerShell code that are used mostly in RDM's "Edit -> Edit (special actions) -> Custom PowerShell command". This offers a simple interactive method to run a snippet of code on currently selected entries. You should note that the snippets available in the ***custom_batch_actions*** area are usable in scripts. When looking for information on how to handle a specific field of one of our entries, it's recommended to look in the whole repository.
